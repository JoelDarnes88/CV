#Target User Profile
The curriculum is clearly geared towards a specific audience in the IT field, with a focus on users who appreciate modern designs and are familiar with interfaces such as Discord. With this niche focus it suggests that the target user is likely to be someone in the technology sector, possibly related to software development, user interface design, etc. It is also very clear and interactive in that it seeks to attract users who value efficiency and ease of use in digital interfaces.

#Information Architecture
The information architecture in this curriculum is highly accessible and logically structured. The information is organised in a way that makes it easy for users to navigate and understand the content. The division into clear and distinct sections, such as "Profile", "Experience", "Studies" and "Hobbies", allows users to quickly locate the information they are looking for without having to scroll through dense or disorganised blocks of text. This structuring helps to convey information effectively, keeping the user engaged and facilitating a smooth and understandable reading experience.

#Visual Design
The visual design of the CV reflects modern and appealing trends, with a consistent colour palette and a style reminiscent of popular platforms such as Discord. With this modern and slightly technical approach it is ideal for the IT and interface design field. The interactivity of the design, with tabs that the user can select to access different sections, adds an element of participation that makes the experience of reviewing the CV more engaging. Also the typography and use of negative space contribute to a sense of clarity and precision, giving an even greater sense of professionalism and attention to detail.
